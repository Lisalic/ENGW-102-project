    <p>Cognitive dissonance: the discomfort experienced when someone holds conflicting beliefs or values. There is no greater cognitive dissonance I feel than being complicit in hustle culture. I am at university pursuing grades, degrees, experience, internships, and validation. I am actively competing with an entire generation and have even managed to convince myself that I enjoy it. I have a front-row seat to this culture and have accepted, on some practical level, that this is the best path for me.</p>
    <p>However, I know, with absolute certainty, that after I accomplish all of these individualistic pleasures, I will feel empty and hollow. I know this is not how the human experience is meant to be. The emptiness I anticipate comes from the absence of joy. My entire generation has been misled to race each other in pursuit of these individualistic pleasures, but joy is the one thing we cannot achieve.</p>
    <p>I wake up early to study, to network, to build my resume. However, I can’t help but think that I am wasting my most vibrant years. I silence that voice because I have bills to pay, because I have ambitions, because everyone around me is doing the same thing. We have collectively agreed to postpone joy for some future where we will have earned the right to it. But that future will never arrive. First we focus on getting into college, then it's landing an internship, then it's securing a job, then it's retirement. The goalposts keep moving and when it's all over we've forgotten how to experience joy at all. </p>

    <p>Unlike other emotions, joy is not possible in solitude. Joy is a shared state of being. It is an event that cannot be contained within an individual. We cannot be joyful alone. We experience joy when we are with friends, family, or community, when we lose track of time, of worries, of sorrow. We are a part of joy, not the other way around. Humans do not exist in a vacuum. We lose meaning when viewed only as individuals. We are not competitors. We are a society and Joy is what brings us together, it is the greatest state of living.
      <p>And the real tragedy is that we know this. All of us engaged in this culture know exactly who we need to be content and live a life of fulfillment. Yet the system forces us to overlook community, familial ties, friendship, and companionship. It has convinced us, and we have convinced ourselves, that we are to compete with these people  instead of connecting with them. </p>
      <p>I had no friends I felt comfortable talking to about college applications. I have no friends I feel comfortable talking to about summer internship applications. I will have no friends to talk to about the troubles in my life. I We will have no friends. We are losing the ability to form genuine connections with people because every relationship gets poisoned by competition.</p>
      <p>Hustle culture numbs us and depletes our lives of this fundamental human need for community. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. In this sick game of capitalism, we are pitted against the very people we need, competing with them over accomplishments and validation that will not fulfill the creeping isolation in our hearts.</p>

    <p>Despite knowing all the flaws with this way of life, we are still complicit in it. I see the thousands of hours I will spend in this battle, as well as the 9-to-5 desk job at the end of it, but I won’t stop throwing my life away because I am a weak weak man. I am unable to accept that I have been, and am, wasting my time. I know that after writing this, I will continue wasting my time. Our compliance is our biggest obstacle towards joy.</p>
    <p>From this observation I have no doubt that joy is fundamentally anti-capitalist. Joy is what we pursue when we see each other as human beings and not human capital. Through this insight, it is easy to see how there are obstacles to joy in every aspect of the capitalist system. Increasingly the system pushes us to build a “personal brand” and “market” ourselves. We are encouraged to look for “networking” opportunities. Our personality and interactions have been commodified. Our relationships are being instrumentalized.  This instrumentalization is the poison that murders the possibility of genuine connection in society and squashes all hopes of one finding joy in their life. We will not have friends and confidants, we will have a network of convenient acquaintances. We are building a society of high-functioning, lonely people. </p>
    <p>We are optimizing ourselves into machines that can produce everything except happiness and we are doing this voluntarily. We are prisoners of our own potential, terrified that if our skills don’t receive the validation we have come to expect, we have committed a moral failing. This is the trap. The hustle provides a counterfeit identity. It tells us that our worth is synonymous with our output. </p>
    <p>Our shortcomings do not lie in not being able to understand our predicament. We see it perfectly clearly, but we still continue our relentless pursuit of metrics. We must be braver. We should look beyond the path of least resistance laid out before us. We should look beyond the repetitive validation we are used to. We have to dare to look for and explore paths where we value people more than progress. We need to stop treating our peers like rivals to beat and start treating them as potential friends. Joy is found in solidarity, not solitude. We should look to choose a life that might look less impressive on paper, but feels much less empty in reality.</p>
